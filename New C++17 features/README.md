# New C++17 Features

- New rules for bracket initializers.
- Cairvoyant constructors—constructors now automaticaly deduce the resulting template class type.
- 'constexpr-if'—simplify compile-time decisions.
- Structured bindings—let smoothly unpack bundled return values.
- 'if' and 'switch' statements now have variable initializers, just like 'for'.
- Inline declaration of variables (previously only functions)—makes it possible to implement header-only libraries w/o using workarounds.
- Fold expressions—let us implement helper functions more simply.
